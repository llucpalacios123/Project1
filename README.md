# Information architecture:


# Visual design: 
The palette i used is this one: E7ECEF, 274C77, 6096BA, A3CEF1, 8B8C89.
I used this palette because there are two differents grey and three diferents blue and it makes my cv web more formal. I used E7ECEF(light grey) color for the background of my web. I used 6096BA(blue) color  for the sidebar wich is located on left. I used 8B8C89(dark grey) when i show the dates in the section of education. I used 274C77(dark blue) to show the progress bar of my skill in some languages. The typography that I used it's 'Georgia' because it's the same typography that New york times uses so i think it's very formal. The layout of my web page is structured in a sidebar that user can use to move into the diferents sections of my webpage, this sidebar is positioned on the left side. The main page has diferents sections that are separated by a title. First section is About me where i show my personal info and a picture of me. The second section is 'Education' where I show the courses I have taken, the diferents courses are in a square where i show the dates, school and name of the course. The third section is Skills where i show a progress bar of my skills in differents informatic languages. The forth section is where i show my work experience and it's a table, but this table only show the border of the middle. The last section it's a form where user can send me a message to me.
